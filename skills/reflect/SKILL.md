# End-of-Session Reflection

Update the current project's reflection and observation documents following the
established protocol. Work through the documents in priority order. If context
is limited, prioritise the top of the list.

## Project Context

This is a cross-project skill. Reflections are always scoped to the **current
working directory** — the project you have been working in during this session.

1. **Determine the project**: Use the current working directory to identify the
   project. State it explicitly at the start of the reflection (e.g., "Reflecting
   on session work in map-reader-llm").
2. **Locate reflection docs**: Look for `docs/notes/reflections/` relative to
   the project root. If this directory does not exist, inform the user and offer
   to create the initial structure.
3. **Tag output**: When writing reflection entries, include the project name and
   session date in the entry header so entries are unambiguous even if read out
   of context.

## Important: Instance Boundary

Reflections are most valuable when written by the instance that did the session's work.
If this invocation follows a compaction or continuation (i.e., the current instance is
working from a conversation summary rather than direct experience), flag this explicitly
in the reflection entries. Distinguish between genuine first-person observations and
plausible reconstructions from summaries.

## Protocol

Process all `.md` files in the reflections directory (`docs/notes/reflections/`), sorted by
the `priority` field in their YAML frontmatter (lowest number = highest priority).

For each document: **read it first** to understand the current structure, entry
numbering, and conventions, then append a new dated section continuing the established
format.

### Conditional documents

Some documents have `scope: conditional` in their frontmatter with a `conditions` field
describing when they should be updated. For these documents, evaluate whether the current
session meets the conditions. If not, explicitly state the assessment and skip.

## Standards

- UK/Australian English throughout
- Concise but substantive — these are research documents
- Continue existing numbering sequences (do not restart)
- Include dated section headers matching the established format
- Update document footers/timestamps where they exist
