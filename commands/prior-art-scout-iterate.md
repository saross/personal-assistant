# /prior-art-scout-iterate — Closed-loop prior-art discovery with verifier-driven iteration

Run `prior-art-scout` + `prior-art-scout-verifier` as a closed loop:
the proposer drafts a candidates table from GitHub / PyPI / npm / HF /
papers / generic URLs; the verifier audits via the corresponding source
APIs; if any claim fails, the proposer applies the verifier's
`true_value` to the affected rows and removes rows whose URLs do not
resolve; repeat. Cap N=5 iterations. Terminate on PASS, on PARTIAL
(flag), on cap, or on no-progress.

Always runs the verifier on every iteration. There is no bypass.

## Usage

```text
/prior-art-scout-iterate [brief]
```

## Arguments

- `[brief]` — free-text prior-art question. Same shape as a direct
  `prior-art-scout` invocation: the question to research, what's
  already been built (anti-target), what counts as in/out of scope,
  adoption-licence constraints, and why the question matters now.

## Behaviour

Thin orchestrator. Invoke agents, extract the machine-readable
`claims.jsonl` and `corrections.jsonl` blocks from their markdown
output (sub-agents cannot Write report files per the 2026-04-19
v4.x evaluation), pass file paths between iterations, track
iteration state, decide when to terminate. All content judgement
lives inside the agents.

### Iteration policy (settled 2026-05-22)

- **Iteration cap:** `N=5`.
- **Iterate on FAIL only.** PARTIAL and `documentation_defect`
  verdicts surface to the user; the driver does not auto-iterate.
- **No-progress termination.** If iteration *k* produces the same
  set of FAIL `claim_id`s as iteration *k-1*, terminate.
- **Flag PARTIAL and `documentation_defect` clearly.** Both
  indicate the proposer's report is acceptable for use but has
  divergences worth surfacing.

### Pre-flight

```bash
ITERATE_ROOT="/tmp/prior-art-scout-iterate-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$ITERATE_ROOT"
```

Each iteration writes to `${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N}/`. Initialise
the no-progress tracker: `LAST_FAIL_SET=""`.

### Extraction helper

```bash
extract_block() {
  # Args: input_file marker output_file
  awk "/<!-- BEGIN $2 -->/,/<!-- END $2 -->/" "$1" \
    | sed -n '/^```jsonl/,/^```$/{/^```/d; p}' \
    > "$3"
}
```

Use twice per iteration: marker `claims.jsonl` on the proposer's
draft, marker `corrections.jsonl` on the verifier's integrated
report.

### Iteration loop

For `N` in 0..5:

#### Step A — Invoke the proposer

- **Iteration 0:** invoke `prior-art-scout` via the `Agent` tool
  with the user's brief verbatim. Run in foreground.
- **Iterations 1..5 (iterate mode):** prompt:

  ```text
  This is iterate-mode invocation N for the closed-loop driver.
  Read the Iterate mode section of
  ~/.claude/agents/prior-art-scout.md, then apply the verifier's
  corrections to the previous draft.

  previous_draft_path: ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N-1}/draft.md
  previous_corrections_path: ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N-1}/corrections.jsonl

  Original brief (do not re-run discovery; preserve PASS claims;
  substitute true_value for FAIL claims; remove rows whose
  url_resolves or doi_resolves is fail):

  [brief verbatim]
  ```

#### Step B — Persist draft

Write the proposer's full return to `${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/draft.md`.

#### Step C — Extract claims

```bash
extract_block "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/draft.md" "claims.jsonl" \
              "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/claims.jsonl"
```

If `claims.jsonl` is empty / malformed: the verifier handles this
via its `_legacy` sentinel; the driver detects and terminates with
status `LEGACY_PROPOSER`.

#### Step D — Invoke the verifier

```text
Verify this prior-art-scout draft for confabulation per the
prior-art-scout-verifier specification. Treat the attached
markdown as your sole input.

[contents of ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/draft.md verbatim, no
edits or commentary]
```

Pure transfer. Run in foreground.

#### Step E — Persist report

Write the verifier's full return to `${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/report.md`.

#### Step F — Extract corrections

```bash
extract_block "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/report.md" "corrections.jsonl" \
              "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl"
```

#### Step G — Read the verdict

```bash
PASS_CT=$(grep -c '"status":"pass"' "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" || true)
PARTIAL_CT=$(grep -c '"status":"partial"' "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" || true)
FAIL_CT=$(grep -c '"status":"fail"' "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" || true)
UNVER_CT=$(grep -c '"status":"unverifiable"' "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" || true)
DOCDEF_CT=$(grep -c '"status":"documentation_defect"' "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" || true)
LEGACY_CT=$(grep -c '"claim_id":"_legacy"' "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" || true)
```

Four cases:

##### G.1 — PASS (`FAIL_CT == 0 && PARTIAL_CT == 0 && DOCDEF_CT == 0 && LEGACY_CT == 0`)

Loop terminates successfully. Skip to Final reporting.

##### G.2 — PARTIAL or DOCUMENTATION_DEFECT (`FAIL_CT == 0 && (PARTIAL_CT > 0 || DOCDEF_CT > 0)`)

Loop terminates without iterating. Final report includes both
sets of non-iterating divergences clearly flagged.

##### G.3 — FAIL (`FAIL_CT > 0`) — continue to no-progress check

##### G.4 — Legacy (`LEGACY_CT > 0`)

Terminate with status `LEGACY_PROPOSER`.

#### Step H — No-progress check

```bash
CURRENT_FAIL_SET=$(grep -E '"status":"fail"' \
  "${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-${N}/corrections.jsonl" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(' '.join(sorted(json.loads(l)['claim_id'] for l in sys.stdin)))")
```

If `CURRENT_FAIL_SET == LAST_FAIL_SET` and `N > 0`, terminate
`NO_PROGRESS`. Otherwise: `LAST_FAIL_SET = CURRENT_FAIL_SET`,
increment `N`, loop.

#### Step I — Cap check

If `N == 5` and verdict still FAIL: terminate `CAP_REACHED`.

### Final reporting

Always return:

```markdown
# /prior-art-scout-iterate result: <brief one-liner>

**Status:** <PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL | NO_PROGRESS | CAP_REACHED | LEGACY_PROPOSER>
**Iterations run:** <0..5>
**Workspace:** ${ITERATE_ROOT}

## Per-iteration trajectory

| Iter | Verdict | PASS | PARTIAL | DOC_DEFECT | FAIL | UNVER | Notes |
|------|---------|------|---------|------------|------|-------|-------|
| 0    | FAIL    | 67   | 2       | 1          | 5    | 0     | initial draft |
| 1    | PASS    | 75   | 0       | 0          | 0    | 0     | final |

## Failure-type distribution across all iterations

| Iter | confabulation | encoding_artefact | metadata_drift | stale_count |
|------|--------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0    | 3            | 1                  | 1              | 0           |
| 1    | 0            | 0                  | 0              | 0           |

(Generated from the failure_type axis on FAIL + documentation_defect
claims. Distinct from severity. Calibration data — record over time.)

## Outcome detail

(Status-specific block — see below.)

## Final integrated report

(Verbatim contents of the final iteration's report.md, including
the corrected candidates table.)

---

**Per-iteration trajectory:** ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-*/
**Final verifier report:** ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N}/report.md
**Final claims:** ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N}/claims.jsonl
**Final corrections:** ${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N}/corrections.jsonl
```

#### Outcome-detail blocks

- **PASS** — "Loop converged after N iterations. All M claims pass
  verifier tolerance. Corrected candidates table below."

- **PARTIAL** (or DOCUMENTATION_DEFECT) — Header: "**⚠ NON-ITERATING
  DIVERGENCES.** K PARTIAL claims (tolerance exceeded within band)
  and J `documentation_defect` claims (numeric value reproduces; the
  `source_method` description is wrong). The corrected candidates
  table below reflects iter-{N-1} corrections; PARTIAL and
  `documentation_defect` values preserve the proposer's text.
  Review the divergences in
  `${ITERATE_ROOT}/iter-{N}/corrections.jsonl`."

- **CAP_REACHED** — "**⚠ ITERATION CAP REACHED.** Five iterations
  did not produce a PASS or PARTIAL verdict. K FAIL claims
  remain. Inspect the final FAIL claims and their fix_hints."

- **NO_PROGRESS** — "**⚠ LOOP STALLED.** Iteration {N} produced
  the same FAIL `claim_id` set as iteration {N-1}. The proposer's
  iterate-mode cannot act on the remaining fix_hints — they may
  be ambiguous, the source API may be returning inconsistent
  results, or there is a methodology mismatch."

- **LEGACY_PROPOSER** — "**⚠ CLOSED LOOP NOT POSSIBLE.** The
  proposer's draft did not contain a machine-readable
  `claims.jsonl` block. Returning the single-round verifier
  output without iteration."

## Failure modes and recovery

| Failure | Symptom | Recovery |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Proposer errors at iter 0 | Agent returns error, no draft | Re-run; nothing persisted. |
| Proposer errors at iter N>0 | Iterate mode failure | iter-{N-1}/ outputs preserved. Manually re-invoke `prior-art-scout` with the iter-mode parameters. |
| Verifier errors | Step D returns error or malformed | iter-{N}/draft.md preserved. Manually invoke `prior-art-scout-verifier` against it. |
| Corrections block missing | Step F extraction yields empty file | Treat as verifier failure. Do not iterate. |
| Cap reached | Status CAP_REACHED | Inspect surviving FAIL claims; methodology adjustment may be required. |
| Stall | Status NO_PROGRESS | Same as cap-reached but earlier. Often an ambiguous fix_hint or source-API inconsistency. |
| Legacy proposer | Status LEGACY_PROPOSER | The proposer agent definition is outdated. Verify the spec at `~/.claude/agents/prior-art-scout.md` has the Machine-readable claims block section. |
| User abort | Loop interrupted | `${ITERATE_ROOT}` trajectory inspectable. Future runs use a new ITERATE_ROOT. |

## Notes

- **Inline-block transport rationale**: sub-agents are blocked from
  Write on `.md` files (2026-04-19 v4.x evaluation). Both proposer
  and verifier embed structured data as fenced `jsonl` blocks with
  HTML-comment markers, driver extracts via `awk | sed`.
- **failure_type axis** (introduced 2026-05-22 from lit-scout smoke
  test): every FAIL and `documentation_defect` claim is classified
  by mechanism (`confabulation` / `encoding_artefact` /
  `metadata_drift` / `stale_count`). The driver surfaces the
  failure-type distribution in the final report — calibration data
  the rubric needs to evolve.
- **documentation_defect status** (introduced 2026-05-22 from
  data-profile smoke test): claims where the numeric value
  reproduces but the `source_method` string is wrong. Non-iterating;
  proposer in iterate mode substitutes the `source_method` only.
- Iteration cap of 5 is rule-of-thumb. Mirrors `/data-profile-iterate`
  and `/lit-scout-iterate`. Tune in light of real experience.
- Per-source-type API verification (GitHub / PyPI / npm / HF /
  papers) is delegated to the verifier; the driver does not parse
  source-type per row.
- Each iteration: one full proposer call (5–15 min for discovery,
  2–5 min for iterate-mode) + one full verifier call (3–8 min).
- Do NOT nest sub-agents. Serial dispatch from main conversation
  is the only realisable path.
- For one-shot (non-iterating) prior-art work, invoke
  `prior-art-scout` directly via the Agent tool. Use
  `/prior-art-scout-iterate` when the cost of an unfixable
  confabulation in the candidates table is higher than the cost
  of an extra 1–3 iterations (e.g., when the brief drives a real
  adoption decision).
